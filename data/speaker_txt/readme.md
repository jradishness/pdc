# Repository of Processed Speaker Text
This is the processed speech from each individual speaker (or group).

#### File Naming Conventions
There are several different types of files in this repository.

##### Single Speaker Files
Files are named with the name of the speaker (e.g. trump.txt, obama.txt)

##### Election Cycle Files
For each election cycle, there are three files (except for 1992, which had 4) which contain all of the speech for a political party for that particular year. When inputting into AntConc, this division allows the flexibility to easily analyze text either by date, or by political party.

Note: In 1992, there was an Independent candidate, and this text was kept separate.

##### Meta-speakers 
Moderator speech is found in the mod.txt file.
Speech of audience members, or special guests, who asked questions of the candidates is found in the q.txt file.

Note: Analysis was not performed on this speech text.
