# Data Repository


The corpus that I have built is composed of 42 different .txt files. Each file includes a transcription of a Presidential debate that occurred between the years of 1960 and 2016. The files currently contain headers with metadata, as well as speech from sources such as moderators and questioners. This data will be processed out in the next step. There are a total of 644,815 tokens in the complete corpus. This data was found, copied, and pasted from the American Presidency Project.
